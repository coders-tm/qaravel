                                        Fitness &amp; Wellbeing facilities, coaching and support. When members share
                                        information with us, it allows us to develop facilities and services that are
                                        valuable to them and we believe that focusing on member-requirements creates both
                                        the best facilities and services and the most long-lasting relationships.</p>
